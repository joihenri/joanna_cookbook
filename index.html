        <h1 class="head">Everything I've Learned about Cooking</h1>
        <div class="basic">This is just a fun little project for me to do because I have way too much free time. In a way, it's for me to practice coding while typing down everything that I have learned about one of my favorite hobbies: cooking!
            
            <p class="basic">My growing knowledge of the subject comes from what I have picked up from my family, cooking shows, and cook books. Everything is pretty much trial and error when applying what I've learned. Sometimes it turns out delicious and sometimes I'm the idiot who burnt a batch of brownies.</p>
            
            <p>Either way, this is my way to keep all that I've learned into one website. Again, I like to keep myself busy and learn new things. Why not learn how to code while documenting everything I've learned about cooking? I say that's a win-win. Or at least my therapist would agree it is.</p>
