        <p class="para">These are all my homemade recipes that I have experimented and perfected, mostly. I say mostly because with cooking, I don't really do a lot of measuring. Cooking is a "taste and see if you like it" art for me. I do have some basic measurements, but as always, adjust how you like it. You want more garlic? I'm not gonna stop you. You garlic that food to your heart's content. I'm not the boss of you.</p>
